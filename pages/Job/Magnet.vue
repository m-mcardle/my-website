The most mature of these innovations come as a trio of products that are marketed together as a part of the Magnet Digital Investigation Suite (MDIS).\n\nThese three tools are Magnet AUTOMATE which automates workflows that forensic examiners might otherwise have to perform manually, Magnet ATLAS which provides collaborative and case management tools for investigators, and Magnet REVIEW which is a web application to enable non-technical examiners to review evidence and build cases remotely while interacting with a more user-friendly interface than more forensically intensive products such as AXIOM. Magnet REVIEW ended up being the team I joined for my co-op term and I will go into far more detail later on.",

They would go over case after case of crimes that seemed straight out of a TV show, and hearing about the impact that Magnet was able to make on these cases was so powerful. When the stakes involve justice for the innocent it cannot be stressed enough how motivating it is to come into work with the right attitude and work ethic. I found it amazing how inspiring these detectives were. They were the real heros so to hear them talk about Magnet's products in such a good light made me so proud to be there (even as a co-op). During my time here we got the chance to hear from guest speakers from Nashville, Scotland, and even Germany. Each speaker came with their own amazing stories about how real crimes were solved using the tools that Magnet has provided.",

For the unfamiliar, Jenkins is a pipeline based automation and continuous integration tool to build, test, and deploy our product. I first worked on a ticket to address an issue that I saw arising involving what I would call orphaned clusters. There seemed to be an issue where one of our build jobs would be triggered to spin up an instance of our product to do some testing on, but after the testing was completed, the cluster was not being torn down. This can be quite a problem when these clusters can cost over $2000 a month. I decided to familiarize myself with the Jenkins pipeline used to build these clusters and the Azure CLI to interact with the resources being created. I ended up using Jenkins environment variables to determine who kicked off the job and then the Azure CLI to automatically tag the resources with the name of the person who started the build in order to maintain responsibility for the clusters. Because of this, it is now far easier to clean up these clusters and save ourselves from spending $2000 a month on a cluster we weren't even using.",

For context, our CLI is used to ingest evidence into REVIEW by parsing either JSON or XML files and extracting the needed information from elements to populate models used in REVIEW. Specifically we were tasked with supporting one of our competitor's data formats which came as an XML export. I should probably add that this was my first major involvement with one of our C# services, so this was an amazing learning experience for myself. This also was about the time where I really felt myself being able to contribute meaningfully to design discussions as I became more comfortable and familiar with our CLI's infrastructure. I remember this so fondly because it felt amazing to contribute to a customer requested Epic in such a meaningful way. It also was so enjoyable to work alongside such an amazing mentor who was so open to collaborate. I think I owe a lot of my growth during my co-op to Christian for being such a great mentor during the work on the project, and it remains one of my most fond memories during my work term.",

However, it just so happened to involve almost entirely front-end and minor application level changes.This meant my Taco sub-team had very few priority items to deliver for this specific release.For this reason we came to the decision that it might be beneficial for me to switch over to the other sub-team (aka the Gadgeteers) to lend a hand.\n\nThis gave me an amazing opportunity to get experience with front-end development. I learned how to develop using component driven design in React.js and found it super cool to work with one of these powerful frameworks.I also got experience with developing packages as we have an internal npm library which I had to work on.This gave me experience working with the Bootstrap library as our main packages are built on top of it.',

I brought this to the attention of one of the team's Senior Developers, Rob. To my amazement, he suggested I should take on the tall task of refactoring the problematic areas of the microservice. He explained that it had become a bit of a mess due to some bad practices sneaking their way into production. For the next few weeks I took on this super exciting project, with Rob acting as somewhat of a project manager/mentor for concerns and questions I had while working on it.\n\nThrough this experience I learned many fascinating concepts involving code completeness and best practices. I also of course learned the methodology involved with refactoring production code. I developed whitebox tests, blackbox tests, learned about what makes code hard to maintain, learned concepts of how to keep code flexible, and learned so much about how to not just write functional code, but maintainable and extendable code.",

I came into the work term with no prior experience with the language and considering almost all of our microservices are written in C# I knew I would need to ramp myself up on C#. I accomplished this goal by signing up on Pluralsight for a C# learning course to cover the language basics, and made a personal effort to give all code reviews written in C# a look so I can learn by example and by asking the other developer's questions about their code. Even with that personal effort I still have to say that I would not have learned so much so fast about the language if it wasn't for my pair programming experience I previously mentioned with Christian. By learning through my Pluralsight course, observing the other dev's new C# code, and an amazing hands-on learning experience working on our CLI, I can confidently say I am now comfortable developing in C#. I would certainly say I have accomplished this goal."

My Magnet mentor Chris warned me that as I became more involved with the team I would find this goal not as appealing and unfortunately that was exactly the case.I believed getting a certification would be a great tangible evidence of my learnings during my co-op, but as I became completely integrated into the team, I found little time to dedicate to this goal.On top of that, the certification itself became less and less appealing as I did more and more AWS courses. It turns out that the certification is targeted at product management or other roles with less of a focus on technical ability.This essentially made the course focused on using the AWS dashboard and learning the high-level definitions of each AWS product. It also put more of a focus on cost-management and other tasks that a employee in a leadership role would care about, and as a co-op hoping to learn about implementations, that didn't align with my current career status.I ended up accepting that this goal would not be accomplished in lieu of the issues I just mentioned. However, I would honestly measure it a slight success because through my co-op term I learned so much about AWS just through hands on experience (even if I don't have a certification to show for it)."

I also think this goal helped develop a very important skill, engaging in discussions without an expert-level of knowledge about the subject. By the end of the term I feel I learned how to ask the important questions during this discussions to understand the problems and possible solutions, without needing to be very experienced with the technologies involved in the problem.This allowed me to contribute my opinion far more during design discussions and when creating acceptance-criteria for a ticket, and I think this growth in my abilities really unlocked a huge aspect of the job for me once I was able to engage in these conversations.I am very proud of how this goal turned out and I would certainly say I achieved it."

For this reason, I made it a goal of mine to attend all social events presented to me (work-permitting).After attending almost all of the term's co-op meetings, I have made friends with plenty of the other co-op students and have remained in touch even after the term.Therefore I would mark this goal as an outstanding success."

However, I knew that the only release left before my term was over was going to be a very important one. For this reason, I decided to take on the responsibility as a co-champion with another developer to ensure all went smoothly.

Because of this, I made it a goal to apply learnings from work hours into personal projects during my leisure time. This gave me opportunity to develop projects in Python, React.js, Bash, and C that I can add to my portfolio to show future employers. I ended up developing a F1 Standings Visualizer in Python, this whole website in React.js and Tailwind, some helper scripts for both projects in Bash, a Roulette simulator for a roommate of mine in C, and a hangman game in C as well. Of course I always will wish I had completed even more projects, but I am very happy with what resulted from this goal and would mark it as a great success."
